      <h3>Modern Slavery Acts</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Under Section 54 of the 2015 MSA, the UK government requires all companies with a turnover of over GB£36
          million per annum to release an annual statement on the actions they are taking to tackle modern slavery in
          their direct operations and supply chains. The 2018 Australian MSA establishes a national Modern Slavery
          Reporting Requirement, which applies to businesses and other entities in the Australian market with an annual
          consolidated revenue of at least AU$100 million. These entities are required to identify and address their
          modern slavery risks and maintain responsible and transparent supply chains.

                In 2016, when the first companies started publishing their UK Modern Slavery Act statements, Walk Free
                and
                WikiRate partnered to set up a research project that could assess their contents; were companies
                approaching
                it as another tick box exercise or were they going beyond compliance?

        <p>
          Drawing on Walk Free's knowledge of modern slavery due diligence and the Home Office Guidance accompanying the
          UK Act, the partnership developed a <span class="tooltip-item" placement="top" tooltipHtml="true"

          to assess the content of the statements.

<ng-template #standardized_metrics_details>
  <p>As the project progressed 3 more standardized metrics have been added. One resulting from the Australian Modern
    Slavery Act requirements assessing “Consultation process” (see table below) and two looking at best practices
    such as companies <a href="https://wikirate.org/Walk_Free+MSA_historic_record" target="_blank">providing a historic
      record of previous statements</a> on their
    website, and making explicit <a href="https://wikirate.org/Walk_Free+MSA_Impact_on_Company_Behaviour"
                                    target="_blank">how the legislation impacted company behavior.</a></p>
