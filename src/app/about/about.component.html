        <p>
          Under Section 54 of the 2015 MSA, the UK government requires all companies with a turnover of over GBÂ£36
          million per annum to release an annual statement on the actions they are taking to tackle modern slavery in
          their direct operations and supply chains. The 2018 Australian MSA establishes a national Modern Slavery
          Reporting Requirement, which applies to businesses and other entities in the Australian market with an
          annual
          consolidated revenue of at least AU$100 million. These entities are required to identify and address their
          modern slavery risks and maintain responsible and transparent supply chains.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, when the first companies started publishing their UK Modern Slavery Act statements, Walk Free
          and WikiRate partnered to set up a research project that could assess their contents; were companies
          approaching it as another tick box exercise or were they going beyond compliance?

          Over the years Walk Free has analyzed and published subsets of the data collected through the Modern Slavery
          Act Research project on WikiRate. Since 2019 these case studies have had a sector specific focus, which so
          far have included:

          <h5>Hotels</h5>
          <p>The hotel sector is the section of the service industry that deals with guest accomodation. It can include
            branded hotels and boutique hotels.
          </p>
          <div class="note mb-3">Note: The hotel sector is a subset of the hospitality sector. The latter also includes
